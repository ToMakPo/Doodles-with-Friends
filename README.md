# Doodles with Friends

### Pod 7: Project 3

## DESCRIPTION

Doodles with Friends is a fun and lighthearted drawing game that is great for keeping up with friends and family without needing to invade their living room. Players try to guess the word that the current active player is drawing and get points for correct guesses!

When a player navigates to the website they are asked to either create a user name or to log in. Once logged in they are presented with a lobby which allows them to create a game and invite their friends with a unique room code. Other players can sign into an existing game with the identifier code that is sent to them by an originating player. Once in a room together players can interact using the integrated chat feature, view the doodles of the active player, and submit their guesses in chat.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

For this application we used Javascript, React, Node, Nodemon, Sockets.io, Sweetalerts, Mongoose, MongoDB, JWT, Axios, Express, BCrypts, Fastest-Validator, and Passport.
